## R Markdown and Plotly

This is my presentation for the third week of the Coursera course on Developing data products.


## The relationship between Weight, Horsepower and cylinders.

```{r cars, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(x = mtcars$wt, y = mtcars$hp, color = factor(mtcars$cyl))
```

## A different way to visualize this relationship

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~hp, z = ~cyl, color = ~cyl, type = "scatter3d")
```
